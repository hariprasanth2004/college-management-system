<p class="ep" >Dear Students,

    Welcome to RMK Engineering College!
    
    The transition from school to college is a very big step in life. You have put in so much hard work in your public exams, spent sleepless nights, earned a rewarding score, and with the suggestions of your parents/guardian you have joined your chosen stream of education to realize your life-ambition and set the foundation for your future. By choosing to create a future for yourself from our institution means that we, the teachers and management at RMK, are also responsible for your successful graduation and growth. You will cherish every day at your college. Right from day one, your seniors, your professors, and members of the administration will get to interact with you. More than that the zealous environment will have you charged up to achieve your dream with confidence like never before. I assure you, you are at home.
    
    It is your career path that you have now embarked upon, which will be a remarkable journey in itself that will prepare you for a life beyond college. We hope to make your journey with us, engaging, encouraging and enlivening as ever, for you to grow as an outright individual, ready to take on life as an adult. We pray and will work with you to see you become one with the society where your contribution will make a definitive difference to our world.
    
    The commitment from us begins from day one – to work with you and walk with you each day all through the years you spend here. It is your home away from home. As I mentioned earlier, the learned staff and the ever-accessible management is there to guide you through your path and help you nurture your dreams and fulfil them – by empowering you to realize your true potential. Be it studies, sports or any extracurricular activities, you don’t just graduate with a degree and a certificate – but become a graduate of life and a true citizen of the world of tomorrow.</p>
